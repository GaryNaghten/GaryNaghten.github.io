		<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
		<h3>All customers requesting services from Cian's Tech World understand and agree to the following conditions:</h3>
		
		<h4>Responsibility</h4>
		<p>It is your responsibility to inform us accurately of the condition of your Device, as well as any repairs, attempted and/or completed. If your Device is found to differ from your description, we will contact you to discuss as further charges may apply. We shall make all reasonable efforts to repair your Device subject to the availability of any parts required.</p>
		
		<h4>Third Party Repairs</h4>
		<p>Cian's Tech World technicians are highly trained to provide service and repairs on your device. We are an independent service provider, and are no way affiliated with Apple, Samsung or any other manufacturer. Although third-party work on your device will void your manufacturer warranty, Cian's Tech World offers its own warranty on the parts and/or service performed by us.</p>
		
		<h4>Data Backup Policy</h4>
		<p>We will not be held responsible under any circumstance for any loss or corruption of data and/or software. Any data or information that you may have stored on the Device shall remain your sole responsibility and we accept no liability for loss or corruption of such data howsoever caused and we therefore highly recommend that you back up your Devices on a personal computer or external hard drive prior to your repair. It is your responsibility to keep a record of any such data.</p>

		<h4>Repair Times</h4>
		<p>Repair times are only estimated and are never guaranteed under any circumstance. Some repairs may take longer due to the specific needs of the equipment during the repair. There is no additional charge for our express turnaround times, or a discount to increase the turnaround time.</p>

		<h4>Passcodes</h4>
		<p>We require the passcode of your Device in order to test the Device before and after the repair, and to provide a diagnostic. If you do not provide this information, this can delay your repair and in many cases, make it impossible to troubleshoot issues and diagnose faults. If a passcode is refused, we can not be held responsible for any issues with your Device as a full functional check is not possible.</p>
		
		<h4>Abandonment</h4>
		<p>Devices are considered abandoned and will be disposed of if you do not make contact with us within 60 days of service completion.</p>
		
		<h4>Water Damage</h4>
		<p>We do not take responsibility for any progression in damage for Devices that have been water damaged. Although unlikely, opening the Device could set off further damage and in some cases may be irreparable. After repair, unknown issues can also arise which are beyond our control. In cases where further repair is needed there may be additional costs incurred.</p>
		
		<h4>Logic Board Repair</h4>
		<p>Component level repairs carry an inherent risk of further damage to your Device. We do not take responsibility for any progression in damage for Devices that require component level repairs.
			
		<h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
		<p>If any Device should be lost or damaged further than the condition it was given to us, our liability will be limited to the cost of repair, or for the replacement of the Device in its condition at the time of transfer to us based on current fair market value. Cian's Tech World has no liability whatsoever for indirect or consequential damages resulting from a repair or repair attempt, any advice given, including any lost or damaged data, software, or lost profits or revenue of the customer.We also reserve the right to refrain from providing any or all services requested and refund your payment, wholly or in part, if minimum system requirements are not met or your requirements are unusual, extensive, or beyond the scope of our services as reasonably determined by Cian's Tech World staff. We shall not be liable for any claim arising under this Agreement unless you give us written notice of the claim within three (3) months of becoming aware of the circumstances giving rise to the claim or, if earlier, three (3) months from the time you ought reasonably to have become aware of such circumstances.</p>
		
		<h4>Data Protection</h4>
		<p>Your name, address and other details are held so we can notify you when your Device has been repaired and so we can give you an efficient after-sales service. We may also send you text messages and/or emails from time to time to alert you to new services that we may provide. By using our Services, you consent to our use of your personal Information as described.</p>
		
		<h4>Website</h4>
		<p>The content of the pages of this website is for your general information and use only. It is subject to change without notice. Neither we nor any third parties provide any guarantee as to the accuracy, timeliness, performance, completeness or suitability of the information and materials found or offered on this website for any particular purpose. You acknowledge that such information and materials may contain inaccuracies or errors and we expressly exclude liability for any such inaccuracies or errors to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
		
		<h4>Warranty</h4>
		<p>iPhone part replacements are guaranteed for the Lifetime of the Device. Warranty is strictly limited to the replacement of the parts. This covers all iPhone parts repaired or replaced, that malfunction, or do not work as intended or designed; EXCEPT in situations that are outlined below:</p>
		
		<h4>12-Month Parts Warranty</h4>
		<p>Newly installed parts in all Devices are guaranteed for 12 months from the date of installation. This covers any laptop, phone or tablet screen and/or LCD and any other repaired or replaced parts that malfunction, or do not work as intended or designed; EXCEPT in situations that are outlined below:</p>
		
		<h4>30-Day Service Warranty</h4>
		<p>We stand behind our tech services for 30 days from the date of service completion. If the problem you are having is a direct repetition of the exact problem which caused you to request service from us, then you are eligible for our warranty; EXCEPT in situations that are outlined below:</p>
		
		<h4>Component Level Repair Warranty</h4>
		<p>Repairs that do not include a component replacement are under warranty for 30 days. Motherboard parts (chips) that are replaced are under warranty for 90 days; EXCEPT in situations that are outlined below:</p>
		
		<h2>Our warranty does NOT</h2>
		<h3>cover the terms below:</h3>
		
		<h4>Water Damage Repairs</h4>
		<p>Due to the fickle nature of water damage, we can only warranty liquid damage repairs for 30 days, even if they are successful. In cases of irreparable Devices, a water damage cleaning fee will be deducted from any refund. In cases where further repair is needed, there may be additional costs incurred.</p>
		
		<h4>Physical Damage</h4>
		<p>We provide a warranty on all repairs because of our confidence in both our high-quality parts, as well as our technicianâ€™s abilities to properly perform repairs. We cannot, however, use this warranty to cover further damage caused to a Device after the repair because this is not a result of either the hardware being faulty/defective or our technicians improperly installing it. Issues with other parts and functions of the equipment since repair are not covered.</p>
		
		<h4>Tampering</h4>
		<p>If your Device shows evidence of having been tampered with, shows broken warranty seals, or shows evidence of being damaged as a result of an additional repair or attempted repair after being serviced by Cian's Tech World, then the warranty is void.</p>
		
		<h4>Warranty Claims</h4>
		<p>Warranty is strictly limited to the parts and/or service that has been paid for. Software issues, data and changes to your Device (including hardware, software and/or antivirus protection program) are not covered. The warranty is valid only for the specific Device repaired and the original customer. It is not transferable across Devices or if the Device is sold or given to another individual. Warranty claims can only be processed and approved by our repair centre technicians. Please return your Device to our repair centres, with your original sales receipt.</p>
