		<h2>Warranty</h2>
		<h3>All customers requesting services from Cian's Tech World understand and agree to the following conditions:</h3>
		
		<h4>Lifetime iPhone Parts Warranty</h4>
		<p>iPhone part replacements are guaranteed for the Lifetime of the Device. Warranty is strictly limited to the replacement of the parts. This covers all iPhone parts repaired or replaced, that malfunction, or do not work as intended or designed; EXCEPT in situations that are outlined below:</p>
		
		<h4>12-Month Parts Warranty</h4>
		<p>Newly installed parts in all Devices are guaranteed for 12 months from the date of installation. This covers any laptop, phone or tablet screen and/or LCD and any other repaired or replaced parts that malfunction, or do not work as intended or designed; EXCEPT in situations that are outlined below:</p>
		
		<h4>30-Day Service Warranty</h4>
		<p>We stand behind our tech services for 30 days from the date of service completion. If the problem you are having is a direct repetition of the exact problem which caused you to request service from us, then you are eligible for our warranty; EXCEPT in situations that are outlined below:</p>

		<h4>Component Level Repair Warranty</h4>
		<p>Repairs that do not include a component replacement are under warranty for 30 days. Motherboard parts (chips) that are replaced are under warranty for 90 days; EXCEPT in situations that are outlined below:</p>

		<h2>Our Warranty Does Not Cover</h2><br>

		<br><h4>Water Damage Repairs</h4>
		<p>Due to the fickle nature of water damage, we can only warranty liquid damage repairs for 30 days, even if they are successful. In cases of irreparable Devices, a water damage cleaning fee will be deducted from any refund. In cases where further repair is needed, there may be additional costs incurred.</p>
		
		<h4>Physical Damage</h4>
		<p>We provide a warranty on all repairs because of our confidence in both our high-quality parts, as well as our technicianâ€™s abilities to properly perform repairs. We cannot, however, use this warranty to cover further damage caused to a Device after the repair because this is not a result of either the hardware being faulty/defective or our technicians improperly installing it. Issues with other parts and functions of the equipment since repair are not covered.</p>
		
		<h4>Tampering</h4>
		<p>If your Device shows evidence of having been tampered with, shows broken warranty seals, or shows evidence of being damaged as a result of an additional repair or attempted repair after being serviced by Cians Tech World, then the warranty is void.</p>
		
		<h4>Warranty Claims</h4>
		<p>Warranty is strictly limited to the parts and/or service that has been paid for. Software issues, data and changes to your Device (including hardware, software and/or antivirus protection program) are not covered. The warranty is valid only for the specific Device repaired and the original customer. It is not transferable across Devices or if the Device is sold or given to another individual. Warranty claims can only be processed and approved by our repair centre technicians. Please return your Device to our repair centres, with your original sales receipt.</p>
