		<h2>Check out our frequently asked questions</h2>
		<h4>How long does a iPhone repair take?</h4>
		<p>We pride ourselves on a fast premium repair service. iPhone can be repaired in-store within 30 minutes.</p>
		
		<h4>Does my phone come with a warranty?</h4>
		<p>There is a lifetime warranty on most device repairs. Please check our terms and conditions for more details.</p>
		
		<h4>How does the walk-in service work?</h4>
		<p>Our walk-in service allows you to have your phone repaired straight away!</p>

		<h4>What methods of payment do you accept?</h4>
		<p>We accept cash, major credit and debit cards (everything except American Express) and PayPal payments.</p>

		<h4>Will I receive a receipt after repair?</h4>
		<p>We send an electronic receipt via email to all of our customers. This includes the service details, cost breakdown and warranty information. If the email hasn't arrived in your inbox, it may have gone into your junk folder. If it's not here, please get in touch and we'll double-check your details and send the email again.</p>
		
		<h4>How does the Dublin courier service work?</h4>
		<p>Our courier pick-up and drop-off service are for customers in Dublin who want to get their device repaired without leaving the office or their home. We arrange the collection of your device using our trusted courier, complete your repair and then return it to you straight away. The whole thing can take as little as two hours.</p>
		
		<h4>How long does the Express Mail service repair take?</h4>
		<p>The vast majority of our express mail repairs are completed the day that we receive your device. We then 
			immediately return your device. This means that your device is usually away from you for just 36–48 hours. As soon as we receive your device, we'll notify you via email. Once your device is repaired, and on its way back to you, we'll send you another email with the An Post tracking details. We use An Posts service, which guarantees the return of your device to you the following day (due to uneven Saturday deliveries, devices posted on Friday may reach you on Monday). Sometimes due to the nature of a repair or circumstances out of our control, we may take a little longer. If this is the case, we will keep you informed of your order status via email. Your order has a unique reference number which you can quote at any time for an update.</p>
		
		<h4>Do you offer ongoing support after repair?</h4>
		<p>We enjoy helping people with their devices – sharing our knowledge, offering useful tips and troubleshooting problems. If there's something you're unsure about after a repair, please get in touch so that we can help you. You can also check out our blog where we share technology tips, reviews and news.</p>
